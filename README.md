Title: Caesar Cipher Algorithm

Description: This Python program implements the Caesar cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts each letter in a message by a user-defined value. It provides functionalities for both encryption and decryption.

Features:

User-friendly interface for inputting messages and shift values.
Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Handles punctuation and non-alphabetic characters without modification.
Clear output displaying the original message, encrypted message, and decrypted message (if applicable).
Installation:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Clone or Download: Clone this repository using Git or download the source code as a ZIP file.
Usage:

Run the Script: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script (caesar_cipher.py), and execute the following command: python caesar_cipher.py

User Input: The program will prompt you to enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt: Enter a message: This is a secret message!

Shift Value: You'll then be asked to specify the shift value: Enter the shift value (positive for encryption, negative for decryption): 3

Positive values shift letters to the right (encryption).
Negative values shift letters to the left (decryption).
Output: The program will display the original message, encrypted message (if applicable), and decrypted message (if applicable): for Encryption Original message: hello Shift value: 3 Encrypted message: khoor for Decryption Encrypted message: khoor shift value: 3 decrypted message:hello
